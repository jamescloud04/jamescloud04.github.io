Portfolio + playground for quick web experiments. Everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS—open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with any static server.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` – hero, about, projects, playground, learning log, and contact sections.
- `assets/css/style.css` – theme, layout, and component styles.
- `assets/js/main.js` – palette, motion, and density toggles.

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve locally (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000` from the repo root).
2. Edit the files and refresh to see changes. GitHub Pages will publish whatever is on `main`.

## Next experiments
- Link real project demos/repos in the Projects section.
- Add a chart (Chart.js) showing commits or uptime.
- Swap the font to something new and add more palettes.
- Embed a blog feed or note section (markdown-to-HTML).

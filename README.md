Portfolio. Everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS—open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with any static server.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` – hero, about, projects, playground, learning log, and contact sections.
- `assets/css/style.css` – theme, layout, and component styles.
- `assets/js/main.js` – palette, motion, and density toggles.
